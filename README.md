SECTION 2 : SELF - EXPLORE (LEARNING PROCESS)

Following are the exploration Steps: Also referencing to concept in document "Getting started with GitHub Actions"

(1) Create a New Repository (name : showandtell)

(2) Create New Workflow (name : HelloWorld) in the new repository. 
This workflow action created the *.YML file under .githubs/workflow/
	filename is blank.yml
    	There is only 1 job (Build)
    	which echo "Hello world"

I understand that gitHub repository can contain one or more workflows. 
And each workflow is defined in a separate YAML in the .github/workflows directory of the repo. 
Multiple workflows may run at the same time in parallel.

(3) With above, do a START COMMIT. Followed by COMMIT NEW FILE.

(4) After COMMMIT. I click on 'ACTION' and observed that the job has been run. 

(5) Upon Job run completion, while attempting to verify the result, coding indicates to 
get to command prompt, spend a long while trying to resolve command prompt issue.

(6) Continuing exploration. 
Discover Run workflow. As well as the SHOW RAW LOG.

(9) Finally, edit and update this README.md file. And COMMIT CHANGES.
