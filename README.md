SECTION 2 : SELF - EXPLORE (LEARNING PROCESS)

Following are my Exploration Steps: AS Doing this for the first time.

(1) Created New Repository (showandtell)

(2) Create New Workflow (HelloWorld)
	  coding file is (blank.yml)
    In this code. There is only 1 job (Build)
    Which echo "Hello world"

(3) START COMMIT 
    COMMIT NEW FILE 

(4) After i did COMMMIT. I click on 'ACTION' and observed that the job has been run. 

(5) On the screen, it indicated Job completed. I want to verify the result further, whereby it indicates to go to command prompt,
However, i spend long while and could not get to resolve command prompt issue.

(6) Finally, I edit/update this README.md file. And COMMIT CHANGES.
